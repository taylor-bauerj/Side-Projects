# Side Projects
A collection of side projects created by me.

This collection includes web development projects with different JavaScript libraries, and different web development techniques. 


Glitch Effects:
This was some experimenting with CSS and different CSS animations.

KO Learning:
Test site using the knockout.js library. Also partially using sammy.js. Site contains several modules of experimentation with knockout.js all inside a single page application.

Three js Learning
Multiple test sites using the three.js library. The library is designed to create and handle 3D graphics on the HTML canvas. These sites are just my own experiments for education.
